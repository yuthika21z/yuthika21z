# Hey, there ! 👋 I'm Yuthika Zodge 🌲 

I m currently pursuing btech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science .I love Data Visualization and have been learning all about it. On my GitHub, you'll find cool stuff I've made while learning , like programs and projects. Matplotlib and seaborn are my favorite python libraries and I like working with power BI too . 


## 🎓 Education
Bachelor of Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (2021-24)
Chh. Shahu College of Engineering, Aurangabad
CGPA: 7.7 

## 📊 Personal Projects

### 💬Sentiment Analysis -
The project starts by preprocessing Amazon packaged food reviews dataset which was availble on kaggle .Leveraging the power of RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art language model, I fine-tuned it on a dataset of labeled Amazon reviews. This process involved training the model to recognize sentiment patterns specific to Amazon products. The model achieved impressive accuracy in predicting sentiment .

### 📽️Movies Recommendation System -
Developed a content-based movie recommendation system with a dataset of 4803 movies
Utilized cosine similarity achieving a remarkable similarity score of 0.95 for precise film suggestions

### 🌦️Weather Forecasting -
Collaboratively developed a robust weather forecasting program leveraging a Kaggle dataset of 96432 entries
Achieved exceptional accuracy rates of 95% and 99% using decision tree and random forest algorithms respectively
